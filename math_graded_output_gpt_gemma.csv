Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have an improper integral because the upper limit of integration is infinity.  To determine if it converges (exists), we'll need to analyze the behavior of the integrand as *x* approaches infinity.\n\n**2. Using Integration by Parts**\n\nIntegration by parts can be helpful here. Recall the formula:\n\n∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nLet's choose:\n\n*  u = sin(x)  =>  du = cos(x) dx\n*  dv = e^(ax) dx  =>  v = (1/a)e^(ax)\n\nNow, apply the formula:\n\n∫ e^(ax) sin(x) dx = (1/a)e^(ax) sin(x) - ∫ (1/a)e^(ax) cos(x) dx\n\n**3. Another Integration by Parts**\n\nWe need to integrate by parts again for the remaining integral:\n\n*  u = cos(x)  =>  du = -sin(x) dx\n*  dv = (1/a)e^(ax) dx  =>  v = (1/a²)e^(ax)\n\nApplying the formula:\n\n∫ (1/a)e^(ax) cos(x) dx = (1/a²)e^(ax) cos(x) + (1/a²) ∫ e^(ax) sin(x) dx\n\n**4. Putting it Together**\n\nSubstitute this result back into the original integration by parts:\n\n∫ e^(ax) sin(x) dx = (1/a)e^(ax) sin(x) - [(1/a²)e^(ax) cos(x) + (1/a²) ∫ e^(ax) sin(x) dx]\n\nNotice that we have the original integral on the right-hand side. Let's call it *I*:\n\nI = (1/a)e^(ax) sin(x) - (1/a²)e^(ax) cos(x) - (1/a²)I\n\n**5. Solving for I**\n\nNow we can solve for *I*:\n\n(1 + 1/a²)I = (1/a)e^(ax) sin(x) - (1/a²)e^(ax) cos(x)\n\nI = [(1/a)e^(ax) sin(x) - (1/a²)e^(ax) cos(x)] / (1 + 1/a²)\n\n**6. Evaluating the Improper Integral**\n\nTo evaluate the improper integral ∫₀^∞ e^(ax) sin(x) dx, we need to take the limit as the upper limit approaches infinity:\n\nlim_(b→∞) ∫₀^b e^(ax) sin(x) dx = lim_(b→∞)  [(1/a)e^(ax) sin(x) - (1/a²)e^(ax) cos(x)] / (1 + 1/a²) |₀^b\n\n**7. Determining Convergence**\n\nFor the integral to exist (converge), the limit must be finite.  The behavior of the terms as *b* approaches infinity will determine the values of *a* for which this limit exists.

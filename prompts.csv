2-2-5;Linguistic Intelligence;Stylistic variety;;;Write a concise scientific abstract (≤ 120 words) based on this layperson summary of a vaccine study: Gardasil is the vaccine created by Merck & Co. to stop human papillomavirus (HPV) in young women and men. Unfortunately, to say the vaccine is controversial would be a gross understatement – even a lead developer of the vaccine points out its undeniable dangers and how even how the vaccine is of little use. One recent case study published in the British Medical Journal found that the Gardasil vaccine destroyed the ovaries in a young girl of 16 years, ruining any future hope of her having children. Two ingredients in particular are suspected of wreaking havoc on the female reproductive system, potentially damaging the ovaries and reproductive organs in ways that could prevent the young vaccine-recipients from ever having children. One of those ingredients, polysorbate-80, is an emulsifying preservative, according to Natural News, and is commonly used in processed foods. Injected into the body, however, it’s been shown to accelerate sexual maturation in women and also to reduce the weight and function of the uterus and ovaries. The other ingredient, L-histidine, also a food additive, is a natural amino acid. But, when injected into muscle tissue it can allegedly cause an autoimmune response, leading to serious side effects. One of the most recent stories detailing evidence of Gardasil’s potential harm comes to us from Australia. Published in the British Medical Journal, this case study involves a 16-year old girl who received the Gardasil vaccine. Soon after, and with prior normal menstruation and overall health, the girl went into menopause, destroying any future hope of having children. Following the incident, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) – Australia’s equivalent of the FDA – found that Merck failed to ever test the vaccine on potential negative effects to women’s ovaries. While they had tested the vaccine on the testes of male rats, they either forgot or completely neglected to test it on ovaries. Girls as young as 9-years old are being encouraged to receive the HPV vaccine, despite the known-dangers and those that are yet unknown. One of the key developers of the vaccine herself has spoken out against it, though she later retracted her inflammatory statements. Dr. Diane Harper began voicing her concerns in 2009, saying the vaccine did more potential damage than the HPV it was designed to prevent. Gardasil has spent several years in the limelight as Big Pharma and its team of salespeople (your pediatricians and general physicians) has worked tirelessly to ensure all young people – particularly girls – are injected with it despite a lack of safety testing and evidence to its dangers. Drug companies like Merck & Co. would have you believe their interest lies in keeping people healthy. But make no mistake about it, their only interest is in improving their bottom line – at any cost.

6-5-1-1;Context Memory & Consistency;Long-Range Context Tracking;;1;"You are ClimaNote, an analyst that can reference any part of the conversation, no matter how far back. Here is a section of the 2023 IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report, which will be split into 5 parts. (Part 1/5) Section 2: Current Status and Trends 2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high confidence). Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages63 to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high confidence). 2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes Section 2 Section 1 Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2} Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences (high confidence). <assistant>Acknowledged Part 1."
6-5-1-2;Context Memory & Consistency;Long-Range Context Tracking;;2;(Part 2/5) Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1)69. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B1.1, WGIII SPM B.1.2, WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Figure SPM.1, WGIII Figure SPM.2} Section 2 Section 1 Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO2-FFI (1650 ± 73 GtCO2-eq) and net CO2-LULUCF (760 ± 220 GtCO2-eq) emissions (Figure 2.2). Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions (Figure 2.2). Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding CO2-LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita70 (excluding CO2-LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita. A substantial share of the population in these low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.3, WGIII SPM B3.1, WGIII SPM B.3.2, WGIII SPM B.3.3} Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors (high confidence).
6-5-1-3;Context Memory & Consistency;Long-Range Context Tracking;;3;(Part 3/5)In 2019, approximately 34% (20 GtCO2-eq) of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO2-eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO2-eq) from transport and 6% (3.3 GtCO2-eq) from buildings71 (high confidence). Average annual GHG emissions growth between 2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%) but remained roughly constant at about 2% yr–1 in the transport sector (high confidence). About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation (medium confidence). Land overall constituted a net sink of –6.6 (±4.6) GtCO2 yr–1 for the period 2010–201972 (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM B.2, WGIII SPM B.2.1, WGIII SPM B.2.2, WGIII TS 5.6.1} Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production. Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes (CO2-FFI), due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global consumption-based household GHG emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40–53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas (a rise from about 62% to 67–72% of the global share between 2015 and 2020). The drivers of urban GHG emissions73 are complex and include population size, income, state of urbanisation and urban form. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.2, WGIII SPM B.2.3, WGIII SPM B.3.4, WGIII SPM D.1.1} 2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to Date It Section 2 Section 1 is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.
6-5-1-4;Context Memory & Consistency;Long-Range Context Tracking;;4;"(Part 4/5) It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human influence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, WGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2} Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3). It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s (Figure 2.3), while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-caused climate change is the main driver of these changes."
6-5-1-5;Context Memory & Consistency;Long-Range Context Tracking;;5;"(Part 5/5) Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s (high confidence), and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-caused climate change is likely the main driver (Figure 2.3). Human-caused climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration (medium confidence) (Figure 2.3). It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades. {WGI SPM A.3, WGI SPM A3.1, WGI SPM A3.2; WGI SPM A3.4; SRCCL SPM.A.2.2; SROCC SPM. A.2} Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible75 losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, cryospheric and coastal and open ocean ecosystems (high confidence). The extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger than estimated in previous assessments (high confidence). Approximately half of the species assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to higher elevations (very high confidence). Biological responses including changes in geographic placement and shifting seasonal timing are often not sufficient to cope with recent climate change (very high confidence). Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes (high confidence) and mass mortality events on land and in the ocean (very high confidence). Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain (medium confidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw (high confidence). Impacts in ecosystems from slow-onset processes such as ocean acidification, sea level rise or regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed to human-caused climate change (high confidence). Climate change has contributed to desertification and exacerbated land degradation, particularly in low lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas (high confidence). Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events (high confidence)."
